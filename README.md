<details><summary> Auto Done Replier (ADR, TADR), by u/MurdoMaclachlan </summary>  

---

- [GitHub](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/tadr)  
- [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/tadr/)

From its README:
> Also known as TADR, this program monitors the Reddit inbox of its user and detects comment from the r/TranscribersOfReddit bot notifying them that it could not find their transcription.

---

</details>

<details><summary> ClaimDoneRemover (CDR), by u/--B_L_A_N_K-- </summary>  

---

- [GitHub](https://github.com/TheodoreHua/ClaimDoneRemover)  

From its README:
> Also known as CDRemover or CDR, this program removes "claim" and "done" comments after a period of time. It is designed with r/TranscribersOfReddit transcribers in mind; specifically those who are tired of these comments clogging up their profiles.

*Warning: this program is known to be prone to a bug that can cause the ToR-Stats Discord bot to freeze.*

</details>

<details><summary> Clear the Queue Counter, by u/--B_L_A_N_K-- </summary>  

---

- [Website](https://www.theodorehua.dev/app/clear-the-queue/countdown)

Provides a counter for how many posts in the queue are Unclaimed, In Progress and Completed, as well as differences with the last refresh. Refreshes every 5 minutes.

</details>

<details><summary> Clone Finder (CF), by u/MurdoMaclachlan </summary>  

---

- [GitHub](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/clone-finder)  

From its README:
> This small tool finds, notifies and documents cloned posts in r/TranscribersOfReddit queue. These clones arise as a result of Reddit sending an error response despite there actually being no error, causing the bot to attempt to post again and resulting in a clone appearing.

*Note: This program is probably not very useful for people who are not moderators, as they can only report clones, not remove them.*

---

- [Wesbite](https://timjentzsch.github.io/color-id/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/TimJentzsch/color-id)

- [Website](https://sites.google.com/view/doesitbreakpirules/)  

---

</details>

<details><summary> Not ToR App (NTA), by u/ILikePokemonGo101 </summary>

---

- [Website](https://transcribing.app/logged-in)

This project is created to streamline the transcription process, allowing quicker browsing of the queue, reviewing of posts' contents and comments, claiming of them, and completion of the transcription through template macros and automatic splitting of transcriptions over the character limit.

*Warning: this program is known to be prone to several bugs, including failure to post "done", occasional failure to post subsequent comments in multi-comment transcriptions, and increased chance of accidentally stealing already claimed transcriptions.*

---

</details>

<details><summary> Not ToR App Mobile Edition, by u/DaOverwatchGuy </summary>
  
---

- [GitHub](https://github.com/ichbineinNerd/not-tor-app-mobile-edition)

Similar to the website edition of Not ToR App, this streamlines the transcription process for mobile.

*Warning: while it is easier to transcribe on mobile with this app than it is with a non-transcription-focused Reddit app, it is still much harder transcribing on mobile than on desktop/laptop.*

<details><summary> Open Source Caretaker for Reddit (OSCR), by u/MurdoMaclachlan </summary>
  
---

- [GitHub](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/oscr)
- [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/oscr/)

From its README:
> More lovingly known as Oscar, this program removes blacklisted comments after a period of time. It is designed with r/TranscribersOfReddit transcribers in mind; specifically those who are tired of these comments clogging up their profiles, thus the contents of the default blacklist.

*Warning: this program is known to be prone to a bug that can cause the ToR-Stats Discord bot to freeze.*

<details><summary> Repost Collection, by u/voidcraftedgaming and u/MurdoMaclachlan </summary>
  
---

- [u/voidcraftedgaming's original GitHub repository](https://github.com/codingJWilliams/ToR-Repost-Collection)
- [Fork by u/MurdoMaclachlan](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/ToR-Repost-Collection)

From the original's README:
> This allows us to transcribe with more ease and get gammas faster, provide image transcriptions for those with vision impairments/ who use text-to-speech software, and those on mobile or with limited data.

The project contains a repository of references and templates for various commonly reposted memes and images. u/MurdoMaclachlan forked the repository because the original is no longer maintained and is somewhat out of date.

- [Overlay Generator](https://timjentzsch.github.io/tor-user-stats/stream.html)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/TimJentzsch/tor-user-stats)

Hosted on the same repository as ToR User Stats (see below), this was created with the intent of making an easy-to-use, stats-related overlay for transcribers who stream their transcriptions, but with a little tweaking can also be used a desktop applet to help you track your stats as you transcribe.
